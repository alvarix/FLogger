In the last branch 'save to source file for Dropbox' Chad 
    - useFlogs.ts
        - add addEntryToFlog and SaveFlogToSource functions to return
            - unless im mistaken, looks like just a start - determining if source is local or DBX
        - also imports saveFlogEntries from useDropboxFlogs()
    - useDropboxFlogs.ts   
        - saveFlogEntries

src/composables/useDropboxFiles.ts (chad)
    -   interfaces for DBX files and file list
        - the file list interface contains methods for launching and clearing DBX connection
        - though I cant see where those methods exist - I assume in the DBX SDK but dont see the connection 
        - eponymous const
            - will come back to this bcs it deals with DBX sdk complexity. Would rather focus on local files for now.



- Use this file as data source
    - outputs NaN/NaN/NaN in the app, doesn't like tabs or dashes?
        - problem was date format, year must be yyyy



Terms
- Flog:  A .flogger.txt file
- Entry: A flog pushed into an array seperate by date, and output in our app currently in a rounded corner box


To Do
- make flog.url display in openFlogs.vue formattable (ie HTML)
    - ie. seperate flog.url into slug (for logic) and label (for display)
- If in DBX - list DBX info (Username and/or URL, Folder, etc)


Bugs
- chad/save-to-source
    - tried testing to see if button was present
        - none for local
        - dbx: file returning nan/nan/nan like my file did when I had the date misformatted
            - it asked to connect to flogger-ccc4 but doesnt seem to correlate to files im seeing in DBX website
