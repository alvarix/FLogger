src/composables/useDropboxFiles.ts (chad)
    -   interfaces for DBX files and file list
        - the file list interface contains methods for launching and clearing DBX connection
        - though I cant see where those methods exist - I assume in the DBX SDK but dont see the connection 
        - eponymous const
            - will come back to this bcs it deals with DBX sdk complexity. Would rather focus on local files for now.



- Use this file as data source
    - outputs NaN/NaN/NaN in the app, doesn't like tabs or dashes?
        - problem was date format, year must be yyyy



Terms
- Flog:  A .flogger.txt file
- Entry: A flog pushed into an array seperate by date, and output in our app currently in a rounded corner box

To Do
- make flog.url display in openFlogs.vue formattable (ie HTML)
    - ie. seperate flog.url into slug (for logic) and label (for display)
